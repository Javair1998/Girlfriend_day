        <h1>Happy Girlfriend Day</h1>

        <div class="paragraphs">
            <p>I saw your post the other day, where you said you're just going to live life 🙏🏾 — and it really made me pause and reflect. Because that glow you've been carrying lately? ✨ I think I might be part of the reason behind it.</p>

            <p>I didn’t sell you dreams 🤞🏾. I simply followed through with the promises I made. I created a reality for you, one that I’ve never created for anyone else before. 🤍</p>

            <img src="../Assest/Girlfriendday1.jpg" alt="Aliyah Smiling" style="width: 100%; max-width: 300px; border-radius: 10px; display: block; margin: 10px auto;">

            <p>From a clueless young man… you’ve been my motivation to give more — not because I had to, but because I wanted to. 💐</p>

            <p>You’ve given me a reason to believe in love again. You reminded me what it feels like to try with someone who matters. 🫂</p>

            <img src="../Assest/Girlfriendday2.jpg" alt="Aliyah Laughing" style="width: 100%; max-width: 300px; border-radius: 10px; display: block; margin: 10px auto;">

            <p>I know we’re not perfect, but the love I give comes with four simple conditions:
            <br>1️⃣ Respect me.
            <br>2️⃣ Don’t play me.
            <br>3️⃣ Don’t cheat on me.
            <br>4️⃣ Don’t break my heart. 💔</p>

            <p>This is the last relationship I have in me. So I ask for honesty, effort, and love — nothing more. 💯</p>

            <p>I’m staying true to my word, and I just hope you keep staying true to yours too. Because this is no longer about potential — it’s about what we’ve already built. ❤️</p>

            <p>So since August 1, 2025, is the first time I’m officially celebrating you as my girlfriend…
            <br>I just want to say:
            <br><strong>Happy Girlfriend Day 🥺❤️</strong></p>
